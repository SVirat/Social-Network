# PalWeb: Social Network

PalWeb is a personal project which replicates the features of other social media sites like Facebook and Twitter, including activities such as adding and deleting posts and comments, liking other posts, adding and removing friends, calculating mutual friends, receiving notifications, searching for other users, and so on.

It was built in the back-end with PHP and JavaScript, and in the front-end with HTML and CSS. Ajax calls are used to dynamically feed the user data from the database. The database system was also designed with ACID properties in mind, with an emphasis on minimizing redundancy and maximizing consistency. A full schema of the DBMS is available further below.
